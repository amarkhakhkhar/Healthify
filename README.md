# Healthify: Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Models

Welcome to Healthify, an innovative project focused on predicting five different diseases using various machine learning models. Healthify utilizes state-of-the-art techniques to forecast the likelihood of Diabetes, Heart Disease, Pneumonia, Parkinson's Disease, and Breast Cancer. This project implements Random Forest Classifier, Extra Trees Classifier, Light GBM Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, all wrapped in a user-friendly web application built with Django, a popular web development framework in Python.

# About Healthify
Healthify aims to empower individuals by providing them with insights into their health risks for common diseases. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, Healthify analyzes relevant medical data to offer predictions with high accuracy. Whether you're looking to take proactive steps towards preventive care or seeking early detection for potential health issues, Healthify serves as a valuable tool for health assessment and monitoring.

# Features
Multi-Disease Prediction: Healthify is capable of predicting the likelihood of five different diseases: Diabetes, Heart Disease, Pneumonia, Parkinson's Disease, and Breast Cancer.

Machine Learning Models: The project incorporates various machine learning models, including Random Forest Classifier, Extra Trees Classifier, Light GBM Classifier, Gradient Boosting Classifier, and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, to ensure robust and accurate predictions.

User-Friendly Interface: Healthify offers a user-friendly web interface built with Django, making it easy for users to input their medical data, receive predictions, and interpret the results.

# How It Works
Healthify employs a multi-step process to predict diseases:

Data Collection: Relevant medical data, such as patient demographics, symptoms, and diagnostic tests, are collected and preprocessed.
Feature Engineering: Features are extracted and engineered from the collected data to represent various aspects of each disease.
Model Training: Different machine learning models are trained on the processed data to learn patterns and relationships between features and disease outcomes.
Prediction: Users input their medical data through the web interface, and the trained models generate predictions for the likelihood of each disease.
Result Presentation: Healthify presents the predictions in a clear and understandable format, along with any necessary explanations or recommendations.
